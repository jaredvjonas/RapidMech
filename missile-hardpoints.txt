MISSILE HARDPOINT RECOMMENDATIONS - IrianTech Mod
================================================================================

Analysis of mechs with limited missile hardpoints (only 1-2 variants with missiles)
Recommendations based on: weight class, battlefield role, and design philosophy

Criteria:
- Support/artillery mechs SHOULD have missile capability
- Assault/Heavy mechs typically support 2-4 missile hardpoints (torso preferred)
- Scout/recon mechs should AVOID missiles (energy weapon focus)
